# thirdportfolio

will include newer skills I've learned over the past few months, with bootstrap template chosen during bootcamp

will include a keylogger, and 'special page'  

will include refined portfolio links,
    ## match bootstrap smoothline links, 
    perhaps svgs? to make the one line drawings? need to get colors from placeholder graphics
will include clear responsive design with streamligned appearance

will have a clean readme with clean markup throughout

next steps are tranfering written information that applies to new portfolio
links to appropriate destiantions in contact and resume and skills present in about.

steps after this are clear links to git and deployed pages.
    cleaned up old bio, and left notes for new development.
